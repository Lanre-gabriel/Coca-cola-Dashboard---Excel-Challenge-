# Coca- Cola-Dashboard---Excel-Challenge

This project showcases the process followed to build a professional Excel dashboard as part of a dashboard design challenge from X(Twitter). 
For me challenges are opportunity to learn, develop and grow.Hence,
the focus was on process execution, not on deriving business insights.
